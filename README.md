All repeater data is obtained from RepeaterBook (https://www.repeaterbook.com). Only FM repeaters and digital mode repeaters where 'Analogue capable' is noted are included.

Naming scheme:
ABC 7 = VK3ABC 70CM<br>
Simplex 146500 = 146.500 MHz

Some files, due to memory limitations of radios, will have lesser simplex frequencies, in somes only the 2 & 70 call frequencies.

For multi-state files the state number, (Eg. 3 = VK3) precedes the repeaters call letters. 

<b>If have a radio not listed and want a file made, read the radio and save/send that file to me. Use the scheme RADIONAME_MODEL when saving it. Also, as a lot of email providers block attachments with a .img extension, rename the extension to .abc to avoid any problems.</b>
